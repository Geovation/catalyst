# Basemaps

Basemaps are the part of the maps you see in applications that provide the context and backdrop to the data being overlaid on top. They normally provide key information showing built up areas, forests, greenspace, names of places and infrastructure such as roads and railway lines.

Basemaps are usually made available either as services available to mapping tools which will allow you to 'point' those tools at them. Or they could be 'raw' data downloads that you need to take and use yourself to turn into your own services.

Ordnance Survey have a good blog post on [effective basemaps](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/blog/effective-basemaps)

We will compile resources here to aid startups in obtaining and using basemaps.


## Where do we choose basemaps?

Our 'catalist' list of datasets has a section for basemap data, so check out those listings for places to go first.
