# CatalyST

CatalyST is a [Geovation](https://geovation.uk/) project to provide geospatial 'Startup in a box' examples and tools for use by the geospatial startup community. It is a project being delivered by the Tech Team at Geovation.

As a tech team we have considered what we get asked the most, and how we can document the work we do so that it can provide benefit to the widest group of people.

Geovation is an Ordnance Survey (OS) initiative, and together with HM Land Registry (HMLR) offers an award-winning Accelerator Programme. The content in these pages will likely feature OS and HMLR data and services, but not exclusively. We are interested in high value datasets for our community, and we would like to create tools that help startups make best use of these to enable geospatial innovation.

## Deployment and cloud services

In the tools and guides within this project we provide specific examples for startups as to how to deploy CatalyST tools to cloud infrastructure. We have focussed on providing examples that work on Azure, and AWS cloud services.

This is by no means comprehensive, but [it is estimated](https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/cloud-market-jumped-to-330-billion-in-2024-genai-is-now-driving-half-of-the-growth) that those two cloud companies cover over half the cloud infrastructure market.

If you would like to see, or contribute, examples from other providers feel free to get in touch.
